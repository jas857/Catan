# Settlers of OCaml

Settlers of OCaml was created as a final project for CS3110 at Cornell University. The project was open-ended, and we made our goal to implement a simulator of the board game Settlers of Catan in the language OCaml. We have included an Artificial Intelligence (AI) player that can play the game as a beginner with the rest of the players. The game is turn based, as is the board game, and allows each player to build roads, settlements, development cards or cities, trade with other players, roll dice, or use development cards.  

Some of the key features in the project are listed below:
  - Display of hexagonal game board using ANSITerminal
  - Player turns and abilities including building items, trading resources, playing cards, and rolling dice
  - Resource collection upon roll of dice
  - Hiding the identity of opposing player cards from other players 
 
Some of the differences that our version had to the usual Settlers of Catan are listed below:
  - Instead of awarding Victory Points for the longest road our version awards points to the player with the most roads built
  - We did not allow for trading between players but players are still allowed to trade with "the bank" and are able to get better exchange rates by building on ports
